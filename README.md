# Recognizing grape breeds based on their leaf images with Deep Convolutional networks

## Introduction
This project was initially a part of my data mining course, but then I found it so exciting and started to read about it and do some research on it by taking advice from my professor [Dr. H Sajedi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YHjV73oAAAAJ&hl=en). So, I tried different things I learned on it, like designing my own network and different methods to get a better result by augmenting data in various ways or exploiting other types of neural networks.

## Methodology
I think it is better to explaine what i did in 5 parts, to make it more easier to follow and faster to search: data, my model, pre-trained models, denoising networks, and auto encode network.

### Data
First of all, down
